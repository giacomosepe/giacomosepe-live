[{"content":"The role of publishing in today\u0026rsquo;s economy # Where are we now #During the industrial revolution, most companies\u0026rsquo; main challenge was to get production right and then communicate how good the output was. Shareholders of these companies would raise capital, get financing from banks and invest in bid tangible assets such machineries, lgoistics, buildings. Most of these of machineries eventually became bankable and companies could leverage both mapower working at their factories and the capital as banks would finance them.\nIn the market of the industrial revolution the difficult part was the production, the organization of the factory, the distribution. Demand for products had an unsteadty growth for more or less the whole XX century and companies could easily sell their production, until at some point (notably the 80s) they had to make heavy use of advertising to beat competition and sell more of their products.\nEnter globalization, computers, and the internet. #The all equation of the 1900 started to crack at the end of the century and is now virtually flipped. Companies can produce most of the goods that the market wants with no particular difficulty. In the XXi century \u0026ldquo;production is easy\u0026rdquo;.\nCompanies can produce almost any product anywhere in the world and ship finished products, components or parts anywhere at a fraction of the cost of just a few decades ago.\nGeographical specialization and information circulation has allowed for high quality products to be manufactured in many countries.\nProduction is not a problem anymore. Companies can\u0026rsquo;t just produce and advertise + sell anymore. Companies are more and more forced to produce their own Demand. Same pattern is seen in the service business, where production can also be decentralized with the cost of international communication collapsing to close to zero. Customer service teams or specialists can be located in any low labor cost country and serve any Western world country as if they were in the same city as the customer.\nProduction of services is easy. And Cheap.\nDemand is the challenge #Since production is so easy, the number of producers skyrocketed, and What used to be easy, demand, is now the most difficult part: today the generation of demand is the biggest challenge for most companies. Emerging from the noise, get customers to trust them and worse buy from them is challenging.\nCustomers have access to so much information that companies struggle to emerge from the noise. Social Media, television, web advertising are trying to get their companies noticed. One of the main indicators for any business operator is the Cost of Acquisition of Customers.\nSo in the late 2010s some companies, mainly tech, started to publish and distribute content it for free to their users. It got labelled Content Marketing.\nContent marketing had a significant growth over the subsequent years into the 2020s. The goal of content marketing is to get customers to know better and eventually trust the companies they buy from. This trust building process has been analyzed and quantified. A Google research estimated that it takes an average of 11 interactions over 4 different media channels to get someone to trust a company.\nTo generate demand companies have to become publishers or media companies #Producing and publishing content is becoming mandatory for most companies both in the services and manufacturing industries, and both B2B and B2C. Producing content is a key competition strategy. Publishing started as a social media strategy, and many companies took advantage of social networks, video platforms (talking to you, YouTube!) and newsletters to build their content.\nIn the 2020s simple social media strategy is not enough anymore. Publishing high quality content on social media is so easy, accessible and cheap that the noise became a deep dense layer of fog. Companies have to use a mix of channels for their content.\nMore advanced companies started creating communities and most importangly started personalizing content down to the level of the single recipient.\nThis is where we are now. AI allows to send personalized communication at scale. Companies that fail to embrace this trend will miss out on the challenging task of demand generation.\nIn an unforseen twist of facts, publishing as an industry mgiht have unexpected resurgence, if it learns how to leverage the new technologies that are coming to the marketin in the mid 20s: AI and Distributed Ownerships of digital assets based on blockchain.\nInteresting and exciting times are ahead of us.\n","date":"25 October 2023","permalink":"/en/ideas/demand-and-offer/","section":"Ideas","summary":"The role of publishing in today\u0026rsquo;s economy # Where are we now #During the industrial revolution, most companies\u0026rsquo; main challenge was to get production right and then communicate how good the output was.","title":"Demand and offer after the 2020s"},{"content":"Developing a set of solutions for daring shareholders who are ready to build iconic digital and media assets that generate additional revenue or improve reputation and brand perception\n","date":null,"permalink":"/en/","section":"Giacomo Sepe | Media solutions to connect businesses and audiences","summary":"Developing a set of solutions for daring shareholders who are ready to build iconic digital and media assets that generate additional revenue or improve reputation and brand perception","title":"Giacomo Sepe | Media solutions to connect businesses and audiences"},{"content":"A small collection of thoughts and ideas centered on writing, business and on how business and publishing might converge.

I am so convinced that I just had an urge to write it and publish it. Just like that.\nLiving like a Google doesn\u0026rsquo;t really mean much, I know.\nSo let me explain.\nGoogle started as a fun venture of two friends. Studying for their PhDs at Stanford. We probably all know some parts of the story. Larry Page and Sergey Brin found what today anyone would call product market fit while building a product they thought would be useful to everyone and that would make the world they lived in a better place.\nThey were driven by a mission. A vision. Their vision was to make the internet easier to navigate, not to build an advertising giant.\nHere is the full story:\nGoogle story\nSteve Jobs, 20 years earlier, did more or less the same. I can see him walking and wondering around the Stanford campus, or, later, in his parentsâ€™ living room: \u0026ldquo;I like computers, I know everything about computers, but I need to make money\u0026hellip; so\u0026hellip; let me think\u0026hellip; who will buy the pieces of computers that my friend Woz and I can make?\u0026hellip; ah the computer store down the road wants full computers and not just parts of them?!, Sure! we will do that, we will make money\u0026rdquo;.\nAlthough nobody knows for sure what he had in mind, and certainly I don\u0026rsquo;t know, his vision was probably very simple, he believed programming and computers would change the world and he wanted to be part of that.\nOnly much later did he came up with his famous vision that \u0026ldquo;every home will have a personal computer\u0026rdquo;.\nBack to Google, I can imagine Sergey talking to Larry in some Stanford garden, more or less in the same tone: \u0026ldquo;we like coding, we can\u0026rsquo;t find stuff on the internet, let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can build something that helps people to find easily stuff online\u0026rdquo;. A few months later they realized (or were pushed to realize) that they could make money out of it. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t intentional at first.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s not just Google. Plenty of other entrepreneurs followed a similar path. They were doing stuff for the sake of it. Or for curiosity. Or beliefs.\nAnd this is my take on what Steve Jobs refers to when he says follow your passion. It is very different from saying \u0026ldquo;do stuff to make money that involves what you are good at\u0026rdquo;.\nThese visionary entrepreneurs ended up building products while pursuing their personal curiosity and were most likely not thinking about what the outcome would have been while at it. In addition, we will never know how many other ideas they had tried before the successful ones. But I am ready to bet that most of those ideas were somewhat aligned with their curiosities.\nReality is, they were not just building products, they were not building a career, they were writing their own life story.\nIn the case of Google and Apple, it happened to be an incredibly rewarding life story. When applied to work, I call Life stories a career path.\nThese three entrepreneurs wrote their life stories and ended up also building amazing careers. So many others, like them, were lucky enough to build a similar career path. And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be some entrepreneurial work, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be anything in particular.\nAll it requires, to be a true life story turned career path, is that it is born out of a genuine interest in something and that it drives decisions throughout life.\nThis of course is not true for all successful entrepreneurs, or successful artists, managers, and doctors. But it certainly is true for these legendary people who shape our current world and many more like them.\nA life story ultimately is what will drive anyone for all their lives. A life story is the glue that will hold anyone together when a product or a job won\u0026rsquo;t work anymore.\nAnd a clear and strong life story has so many benefits!\nThe main one, and here is my main point, is that it allows anyone to become a portfolio of products. Just like Google. A single-person multinational. A \u0026ldquo;multi-preneur\u0026rdquo;!\nWhatever they do, whatever activity, business, job, or venture is going to make sense as it goes back to that life story.\nLife stories are more relevant and more impactful than passion, skills, or even goals and missions. Those are \u0026ldquo;plot\u0026rdquo;. A life story is The story. It is what drives the protagonist ahead. And it\u0026rsquo;s made of a beginning, an inciting incident, a mission, some complications, a solution (hopefully!), and an end (for sure\u0026hellip;). Everyone should think about his life story before coming up with the plot. The plot is what happens IN the life story. It\u0026rsquo;s not the story.\nA little reminder of this plot vs story:\nMasterclass: Plot vs Story\nBoth Google and Apple, among many others, are run as a portfolio of products.\nThere you have it, this is what I meant. These companies really are like holding companies with a bunch of subsidiaries. Extremely connected to each other.\nThey are run as Products Operating Model. Read Marty Cagan amazing article on this:\nProduct Operating model\nBoth Google and Apple have the strength to launch, test, develop, or cancel products continuously.\nSome of these products are very expensive, some others are free, or are free for some and paid for others. Some products are physical, some are digital. They all cater to different needs. Yet, they are all connected and share a common purpose.\nCONCLUSION\nI argue that we should learn to live like Google, I think everyone can BE a little portfolio of products. A multi-preneur. Maybe with one revenue stream, perhaps more than one, but certainly with several products (and services) that all contribute to an overall result: your life story. Productize yourself. Follow your life story, live like a Google.\n","date":"25 October 2023","permalink":"/en/ideas/live-like-google/","section":"Ideas","summary":"I woke up this morning with this crazy idea and I decided to write about it, without too much research.","title":"Live like Google"},{"content":"De Picciotto is a Swiss family with several assets in Southern Italy, as the investor has acquired over several years many real estate assets in the Puglia region, including masserias, hotels, and other entertainment facilities such as a beach club, a cinema, and an events location.\nChallenge #In 2020/21 the company had to decide how to face the liquidity crunch followed the lockdown measures introduced by the European governments limiting movement and thus tourism.\nInsight #The company had a very strong reputation for quality and high end services and had also developed a format that HNW clients had appreciated while staying at the properties.\nSolution #We decided to create a brand, Pettolecchia, that would function as HQ and as guarantee of quality and service for all the properties in Puglia and Sicily.
